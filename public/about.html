<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I go to LIU Post and I am currently majoring in mathematics there. I have always loved critical thinking and have recently 
  started to explore Computer Science. The more I get into it, the more I realize how fascinating this field is. It combines
my love for logic and reasoning with my intense creativity and technical skills. I now understand why this is such a vastly sought
after carear choice, especially for people who can't keep their hands off of electronics like myself.</p>

<p>I firmly believe that my wide range of skills mixed with my varied experience in different work setting will prepare me for an
  internship/job in computer science. Not only do I possess great collaborative skills that help me prosper in any group setting, 
  but I also have critical experience from working on many challenging tasks throughout my academic carear. Because of these facts, 
  I know I would be a great addiition to the intriguing world of Computer Science.
